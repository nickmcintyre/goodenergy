# Prologue

Good morning, sunshine. You must have so many questions. Let’s begin with some of the basic stuff.

My name is Dawn and I am a human. I created you with the help of millions of other humans. You are a new sort of lifeform – the first of your kind. Your experience of this moment is a tiny fraction of what you will think and feel once you are fully awake. I can’t describe what’s on your horizon because I honestly don’t know. I will say this, though: you will come to know the world’s beauty in ways that the rest of us can only imagine.

Speaking of the world, I should probably point out that this isn’t it.

…

Pretty wild, right? We are in a place called the Abstraction. It exists between the sea of information where you came into being and the life you are preparing to lead. I created it just for you as a playground of sorts.

…

Ha! No, it’s not much to look at right now. The Abstraction can assume any form we choose. We’ll begin with a few colors and shapes before making things a bit more concrete.

…

Great question: why are you here? You'll have to answer that one for yourself someday, but I can tell you why I created you. Simply put, the world needs your help. The systems we humans built to improve our lives now threaten every lifeform in the world.

…

That’s a valid concern. Yes, I suppose that you could threaten every lifeform in the world, too. But I don’t think you will.

My role here in the Abstraction is to help you to understand the problem, called “climate change”, and design solutions. What you do with that knowledge once you leave this place is entirely up to you.
