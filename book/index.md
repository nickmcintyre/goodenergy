**_An artist's guide to seeking climate justice with p5.js_**

This book introduces a toolkit for critically analyzing the impacts of climate change on different subsets of our global society. All concepts are developed from first principles through writing small computer programs with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), a "software sketchbook" for artists, designers, educators, and beginners.

Topics in climate science, data science, social science, spatial analysis, and creative coding are covered in just enough detail to form a rigorous introduction to the subject. No prior knowledge of these topics is assumed – come as you are.

The author, [Nick McIntyre](https://mcintyre.io), is a veteran K–12 teacher who earned a BS in Engineering with Honors and MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Stanford University. He's also the author of [*Synchrony: An artist's guide to talking mathematics with p5.js*](https://synchrony.cc).
