# Good Energy

**_Getting started with renewable energy and generative design in p5.js_**

This book introduces the theory and design of electric power systems driven by wind and sunshine. All concepts are developed from first principles through writing small computer programs with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), a "software sketchbook" for artists, designers, educators, and beginners.

Topics in mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, data science, and design are covered in just enough detail to form a rigorous introduction to the subject. No prior knowledge of these topics is assumed – come as you are.

The author, [Nick McIntyre](https://mcintyre.io), is a veteran K–12 teacher who earned a BS in Engineering with Honors and MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Stanford University.
